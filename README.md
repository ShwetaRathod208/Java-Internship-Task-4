# Java-Internship-Task-4
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

   
        The Employee Management System is a Java-based console application developed to efficiently manage employee records within an organization. The system provides a structured way to store, update, retrieve, and analyze employee information while ensuring data persistence through file handling.
        This application is designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and makes extensive use of Java Collections to handle employee data dynamically. It helps reduce manual record-keeping and improves data accuracy and accessibility.
              The main purpose of the Employee Management System is to:
        •	Simplify employee record management
        •	Automate CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
        •	Enable quick searching and reporting
        •	Store employee data permanently for future use


2. PROJECT OBJECTIVES

      The main goals of this project are:
      • Centralized Employee Data Management – Store and manage all employee information in a single, organized system.
      • CRUD Operations – Efficiently Create, Read, Update, and Delete employee records.
      • Search Functionality – Quickly search employee records by ID, Name, or Department.
      • Data Persistence – Ensure employee data is retained even after the program is closed, using file save and load operations.
      • Salary Calculation & Reporting – Analyze employee salaries and generate reports including total, average, highest, and lowest salary.
      • Department-wise Summary – Provide department-level insights, such as number of employees and average salary per department.
      • Robust Exception Handling – Gracefully handle file errors, invalid inputs, or data inconsistencies without crashing the program.
      • Menu-driven User Interface – Provide an interactive console-based interface for users to perform operations easily.
      • Efficient Lookup – Use HashMap for fast access and retrieval of employee records by their ID.
      • Flexible Data Storage – Store employee data in text (.txt) files using serialization or file I/O operations.
      • Beginner-friendly & Extendable – Simple, easy-to-understand design that can be extended in the future with additional features like performance tracking or leave management.

3. SETUP & INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
   
        1.	Install Java Development Kit (JDK) on the system
        2.	Download JDK from the official Oracle or OpenJDK website
        3.	Verify Java installation by running the command: java -version in the command prompt
        4.	Install a Java-supported IDE such as Eclipse or Visual Studio Code
        5.	Open the IDE and create a new Java project
        6.	Name the project as EmployeeManagementSystem
        7.	Create a package named as INTERNSHIP
        8.	Inside the package, create the following Java class files:
        o	Employee.java
        o	EmployeeManagementSystem.java
        o	EmployeeFileHandler.java
        o	EmployeeReportGenerator.java
        9.	Copy the respective source code into each file and save them
        10.	Compile the project to ensure there are no errors
        11.	Run the EmployeeManagementSystem.java file which contains the main() method
        12.	The menu-driven Employee Management System will start in the console, allowing you to add, view, search, update, delete employees, generate reports, and save/load data
